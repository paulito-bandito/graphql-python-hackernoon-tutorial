# Activating Python
It's a pain in the butt setting python up, but it works like this:

- Use `pyenv install 3.6` to install the python used for this tutorial:
- Then, you find where it installed to and issue a "create virtual env" command like this (using the python version you want to use): ` /Users/username/.pyenv/versions/3.6.15/bin/python3.6 -m venv venv`. The first `venv` says create the virtual env, the second `venv` says put it in a folder called this.
- Then you activate it using `. venv/bin/activate`
